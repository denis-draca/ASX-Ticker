<h1>ASX Ticker</h1>

This is a simple ASX portfolio tracking application. Still in development, still plenty to do but basic functionality is there.

Uses the Yahoo finance API (Hosted at RapidAPI) to update ticker values being tracked and update current portfolio value.

<b>Plans to add</b>:
- Save, load and Export functionality
- Charts with different scale selectors and signal series overlays
- Simple predictions, determine whether a trend is up or down (Definitely a lagging predictor)
- Probably more


Will require a Rapid API key to function, make an account over at [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/) and subscribe to Yahoo finance
